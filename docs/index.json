Your attendance status will be verified with the Zoom meeting data. Lab The secret word will be given towards the beginning of section. You can use this time to work on the lab assignment and ask any questions. If you complete the lab assignment before section, you can submit your okpy link as the secret word for credit. Contact Please use Piazza or office hours for debugging and general logistical questions. I\u0026rsquo;m happy to respond to emails, but there are almost 100 students enrolled in my section so it\u0026rsquo;s a bit difficult. Emails should generally be reserved for personal or section-specific matters. Dozens of staff monitor Piazza all day, so you\u0026rsquo;ll recieve a much faster response there.

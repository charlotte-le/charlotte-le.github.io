If you\u0026rsquo;re missing points, it\u0026rsquo;s likely because the email you used to fill out the attendance form didn\u0026rsquo;t match the email you used to join the Zoom or you joined the Zoom as a guest. In the future, I\u0026rsquo;ll require Berkeley emails for both to avoid this. There were some responses where the incorrect section was ticked too. Please fill out this form if you\u0026rsquo;re missing any points. I\u0026rsquo;ll look into each response manually to update the points. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to include any explanation or evidence because I have it all in record. If there\u0026rsquo;s an issue, I\u0026rsquo;ll send you an email. Sorry for the inconvenience! Attendance Discussion The secret word will be given at the end of section. You must attend the entire section. Your attendance status will be verified with the Zoom meeting data. Lab The secret word will be given towards the beginning of section. You can use this time to work on the lab assignment and ask any questions. If you complete the lab assignment before section, you can submit your okpy link as the secret word for credit. Contact Please use Piazza or office hours for debugging and general logistical questions. I\u0026rsquo;m happy to respond to emails, but there are almost 100 students enrolled in my section so it\u0026rsquo;s a bit difficult. Emails should generally be reserved for personal or section-specific matters. Dozens of staff monitor Piazza all day, so you\u0026rsquo;ll recieve a much faster response there.
